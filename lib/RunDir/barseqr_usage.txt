By default, the input directory includes FEBA_BarSeq.tsv,
genes.GC, and setname.poolcount, and the "all.poolcount" file is
also written to this directory.  This script requires the genes
table to include the fields locusId, sysName, scaffoldId, begin,
end, and strand, and the experiments table to include the fields
SetName, Index, Description, and Date_pool_expt_started.  See
../lib/FEBA.R for additional requirements for the R step.

By default, all sets in the experiments table are processed except
for test sets, which are ignored.  If no set.poolcount is
available, a warning is issued. Optionally, the specific set(s) to
process can be specified.

Sometimes a set is sequenced on multiple lanes. The extra files
should have suffixes. E.g. for set1, the files would be "set1b" or
"set1_repN" or "set1_seqNN". A warning is issued whenever this
occurs. Otherwise, the SetName in the experiments table should
exactly match to indir/SetName.poolcount and indir/SetName.colsum.

Creates files in the output directory that can be used by
RunFEBA.R to compute fitness values and create a mini web site in
the output directory. These files are genes, pool, exps, and
all.poolcount, which contains the barseq data for each strain in
the pool, along with whether the strain is in a gene.

Note -- the R step is parallel, use the MC_CORES environment
variable to control it.

Note -- by default, strainusage files in the input directory are
used if present. Use FEBA_NO_STRAIN_USAGE=1 to turn this off.
